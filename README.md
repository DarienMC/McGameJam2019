# Le Condamné

## Overview
[Le Condamné](https://yisas.itch.io/la-condamne) is a submission for the [McGame Jam](http://mcgamejam.com/) 2019 edition, developed in 48 hours using Unity3D.

A pact was broken, and you’ve been damned by the devil to fly the chasse-galerie forever through the night as punishment. Unfortunately for you, this is no magical legend… The canoe does not actually fly, so your sorry self is stuck with it, running away from the angry devil through the streets. Is this a legend come true or just your drunken reality?

Dodge the potholes and orange cones, and drink beer which will give you energy to go on, as the devil attacks you with Fireballs. Make sure not to miss any beer… It gives the devil his ultimate power.

Inspired by the legend of the [Chasse-galerie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chasse-galerie).
